## What can I do with the random walk?

1. Here you'll find an input where you have to enter the number of iterations that you want to repeat the simulation and the graphic.
2. then there is a button to graph, please click it, and then  a new graphic will appear.
3. the next step is clicking the "calcular datos" button to see the results of the average and  the number of games won and lost.
4. if you want to restart the process you have to refresh the page.
